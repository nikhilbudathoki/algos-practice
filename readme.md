# Intro

Implementing common data structures and algorithms. I will also be experimenting with a concept called **Spaced Repition** to improve knowledge retention. 
Codebase is implemented in JavaScript or Python. 

##  Subjects covered include:

1. #### Classic Recursion

2. #### Searching Algorithms(KVM Search, Binary Search etc.)

3. #### Sorting Algorithms(Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Radix Sort, etc.)

4. #### Linked Lists(Singly linked and doubly linked)

5. #### Stacks + Queues

6. #### Binary Trees

7. #### Tree Traversal

8. #### Binary Heaps

9. #### Hash Tables

10. #### Graph Traversal

11. #### Dijkstra's Algorithm

12. #### Dynamic Programming
